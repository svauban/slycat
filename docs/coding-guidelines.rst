Coding Guidelines
=================

* All new Python code in Slycat should follow the guidelines outlined in `PEP 8 <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008>`_ with one exception: we use two spaces for indentation instead of four.  We have lots of code that predates those guidelines, but are actively updating it as we go along.
